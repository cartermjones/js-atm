# js-atm
This is a mock-up ATM UI that I built in JavaScript.

The UI is for the fictional WestBank. There are a few predefined accounts, and users can add accounts within a session. 

Users can log in, create an account, withdraw, deposit, and transfer "money." 

The design is minimalistic, as are the functions.

It was fun to build, though, and it could serve as a starting point to build something more robust and useful.
